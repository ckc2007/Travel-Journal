## Installation

please install all required dependencies to run this from your console. npm i >> then npm start to initialize the program. We use mysql to manage our database, so the user will need to first initiate the database in their system using the command mysql, followed by source schema.sql; to create the database in their system locally.

## Usage

Once the program has been initialized, the user can create a login profile and once logged-in, can begin to create stories for their points of interest. Each story is essentially a journal entry that will take the name of a place or activity, the cost of the activity, a description and optional photos upload. The story will then be displayed in their profile pannel, and will be visible to all users on the homepage. All users can comment on any story.
